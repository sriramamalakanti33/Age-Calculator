# Age-Calculator 

A simple yet powerful Python script to calculate your exact age in years, months, and days—down to the second! Perfect for tracking milestones, birthdays, or just satisfying your curiosity.  

## Features ✨  
  **Precise Age Calculation** – Know exactly how old you are (or someone else is) in years, months, and days.  
  **Error Handling** – Prevents invalid dates (future dates, incorrect formats).  
  **Built-in Python Modules** – No extra installations needed! Uses only `datetime`.  
  **User-Friendly** – Simple prompts guide you through the process.  

## How It Works ⚙️  

1. **Input Your Birthdate** 📅  
   - Enter your birthdate in `DD-MM-YYYY` format.  
   - Example: `15-08-1990`  

2. **Instant Age Calculation** ⏱️  
   - The script calculates the difference between today and your birthdate.  
   - Adjusts for months and days to ensure accuracy.  

3. **Get Your Age!** 🎉  
   - Displays your age in a clean, readable format.  
   - Example: `You are 33 years, 4 months, and 10 days old.`  

## Example Usage 💻  

```python
Enter your birthdate (DD-MM-YYYY): 25-12-2000  
You are 23 years, 4 months, and 15 days old. 🎂  
```

## Why Use This? 🤔  
- No external dependencies—just pure Python! 🐍  
- Great for learning date manipulation in Python.  
- Fun way to check how much time has passed since your last birthday.  

## Try It Out!   
Simply run the script, enter your birthdate, and discover your exact age!  

```bash
